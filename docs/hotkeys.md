  # Hotkeys
  We try to use the same hotkeys for every emulator but some of them have their own different hotkeys, shown here:

| Emulator | Menu | Exit | Pause | Load State | Save State | Full Screen | Special |
|-----------|-----|------|-------|------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| RetroArch ||Select+Start||||||
| Yuzu      ||Select+Start||||||
| Ryujinx   |L3+R3|Select+Start|Select+A|Select+L1|Select+R1|||

*Nintendo emulators often refers to "A" in the emulated sense (physichal Steam Deck "B")
**You need to activate Steam Input in order to use these hotkeys

  ## Steam Controller Configurator
  We also provide a set of configurations for a few specific apps and emulators.
  These are installed according to the [Steam Input Wiki](https://steaminput.wiki/en/making-configs/community-configs)
